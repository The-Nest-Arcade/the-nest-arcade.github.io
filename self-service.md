# Membership Self-Service Rules
- Always check-in at the entrance with the QR Code when entering. A check-in is valid for the whole day.

- You may bring up to two guests with you at any time. If you are interested in bringing more than two during non-open hours, please reach out ahead of time to get approval from staff.

- Always keep the door closed and do not let in anyone that you do not know.

- Machines are controlled by an Amazon Echo. You can control the power to the machines by issuing commands to Alexa. There is a full list of machine names and commands listed [here](machine-operation.md).

- You may change machine volumes, but keep them to a minimum when you are alone.

- You may turn on lights/open windows.
  - If there are other people already in the arcade, please ask before turning on/off the lights.
  - Make sure you turn off/close anything that YOU turned on/opened before you leave.

Issues or problems with any machines can be reported in the [#help-and-feedback](https://discord.gg/qktweaJXKJ) Discord channel or by messaging staff.
