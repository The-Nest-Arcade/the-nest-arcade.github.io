# Information & Rules
The Nest Arcade is a community arcade with a focus on rhythm gaming. We operate on a limited amount of open hours each week, as well as a membership-based self-service model that allows members to visit any time on their own.

- __Open Gym__ is our standard open hours for visiting the arcade. Everyone is welcome to visit during these scheduled times. Hours are posted [here](https://member.nest.cab/calendar.html).

- __Freeplay__ events are typically held every Friday from 7pm-Midnight. These events are also open to everyone and do not require any sort of payment. Check the schedule or Discord events to know when these are happening.

- __Self-Service__ is available to members 24 hours a day. You can become a member by purchasing at least a 5-punch card and going through the onboarding process. __Please thoroughly read this document, as well as the [self-service](self-service.md) document prior to attempting to be onboarded.__

## General Rules
- You must have an active punch card, monthly membership, or purchase a single day pass for entry to non-freeplay events. A punchcard cannot be shared between more than one person. Day passes may be paid for with cash. Please put cash in the red money box.
  - Passes can be purchased online at [https://member.nest.cab](https://member.nest.cab/)

- All non-members must always be accompanied by a member during non-open or -freeplay hours. 

- Everyone is required to check-in via the QR code at the entrance of the Nest for all non-freeplay visits. Every time! No exceptions!!! >:O We are looking to make this process easier but bear with us for now.
